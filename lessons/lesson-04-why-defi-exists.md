# Why DeFi Exists

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/intro-to-defi-media/images/lesson_04/intro-to-defi_04_header.png)


**Core concept:** DeFi emerged to create a financial system that's open to everyone, operates 24/7, and doesn't require trusting intermediaries who can say "no."

## 24/7 Global Access Story

Imagine it's Sunday night. You need to:
- Exchange some currency urgently
- Access a line of credit for an emergency
- Move money internationally for a time-sensitive deal

In traditional finance:
- Banks are closed
- International transfers wait until Monday
- Loan applications take days or weeks
- You're stuck

In DeFi:
- Swaps execute immediately
- Collateralized loans available instantly
- Global transfers in minutes
- No waiting, no asking permission

This isn't a hypothetical. For businesses, travelers, and people in crisis situations, the inability to access financial services outside business hours causes real problems.

## The Inclusion Problem

1.4 billion adults globally are "unbanked"—no bank account at all.

Another 2+ billion are "underbanked"—limited access to financial services.

**Why?**
- No nearby bank branches
- Can't meet minimum balance requirements
- Lack required documentation
- Discriminated against
- In countries with unstable banking systems

**DeFi's answer:**
Anyone with a smartphone and internet can access:
- Savings accounts (lending protocols)
- Currency exchange (DEXs)
- Loans (collateralized borrowing)
- Investment tools

No applications. No minimums. No credit checks. No discrimination.

---

## The Trust Problem

Traditional finance requires trusting:
- Banks to hold your money safely
- Governments to maintain currency value
- Institutions to follow their stated rules
- Companies not to freeze your account

This trust is usually well-placed. But not always:

**Bank failures:** Cyprus 2013—bank accounts over €100,000 partially seized.

**Currency collapse:** Venezuela, Zimbabwe—life savings evaporated.

**Account freezes:** Legal but controversial activity leading to accounts closed.

**Deplatforming:** Payment processors refusing service for political reasons.

DeFi offers an alternative: instead of trusting institutions, you verify code. Rules are transparent, execution is automatic, and no single entity can deny you access.

---

## The Efficiency Problem

Traditional finance is expensive and slow because of all the intermediaries:

**International transfer:**
- 5-7 intermediary banks
- 3-5 business days
- $30-50 in fees
- Exchange rate markup

**Getting a loan:**
- Application forms
- Credit checks
- Human underwriting
- Days to weeks of waiting

DeFi streamlines this:

**Crypto transfer:**
- Direct wallet to wallet
- Minutes to hours
- Usually under $1-10
- Market exchange rates

**DeFi loan:**
- Deposit collateral
- Borrow instantly
- No applications or approval
- Available 24/7

---

## The Innovation Problem

Traditional finance innovation is slow:

- Regulations require approval for new products
- Legacy systems are hard to change
- Incumbents have little incentive to disrupt themselves
- Permission required at every step

DeFi is permissionless:

- Anyone can build new protocols
- Protocols can compose with each other
- Innovation happens in public, rapidly
- Good ideas spread fast

This has led to entirely new financial products in years that traditional finance hasn't developed in decades.

---

## What DeFi Doesn't Solve (Yet)

Be honest about limitations:

**Consumer protection:** No safety nets for mistakes.

**Complexity:** Requires technical understanding.

**Volatility:** Built on volatile assets.

**Regulatory status:** Legal framework still developing.

**Scaling:** Can get expensive during high demand.

**Real-world integration:** Can't pay rent or taxes with DeFi yields (easily).

DeFi solves some problems while creating others. Understanding both helps you decide when it's appropriate.

## Key Takeaways

- **DeFi exists because traditional finance has gaps**: excluded populations, limited hours, trust requirements
- **24/7 access** solves real problems for global users
- **Financial inclusion** reaches the unbanked and underbanked
- **Trust in code vs. institutions** offers an alternative for those who need it
- **Efficiency gains** reduce time and costs for certain operations
- **Permissionless innovation** enables rapid development of new tools
- **Trade-offs exist**—DeFi solves some problems while creating others
