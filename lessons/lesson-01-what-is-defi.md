# What is DeFi?

**Core concept:** DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a system of financial services—like borrowing, lending, and trading—that operates on blockchain without traditional banks or intermediaries.

## Vending Machine Banking

Remember comparing crypto to vending machines earlier? DeFi takes this further.

Imagine if instead of just snacks, vending machines could:
- Give you a loan (put in collateral, get money)
- Let you exchange currencies
- Pay you interest on deposits
- All without any human banker

That's DeFi. Financial services that work like vending machines: put in the requirements, get the result. No applications. No waiting. No banker saying yes or no.

The "vending machine" is a smart contract on blockchain. The rules are code. Anyone who meets the requirements can use the service.

## What DeFi Replaces

DeFi recreates traditional financial services:

| Traditional | DeFi Equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Stock exchange | Decentralized exchange (DEX) |
| Bank savings account | Lending protocol |
| Bank loan | Collateralized borrowing |
| Insurance | DeFi insurance protocols |
| Investment funds | Yield aggregators, DAOs |

The services are similar. The mechanism is completely different.

Instead of companies and employees processing your requests, smart contracts execute automatically based on code.

## Why "Decentralized" Matters

**Centralized (traditional):**
- One company controls the service
- They decide who can participate
- They set the rules
- They can freeze accounts, deny service
- They profit from being in the middle

**Decentralized (DeFi):**
- No single entity controls
- Anyone can participate (if you have crypto)
- Rules are transparent (open source code)
- No one can freeze your access
- Protocol fees, if any, often distributed to users

Decentralization isn't about being anti-bank. It's about having options that don't require trusting a single intermediary.

## The Building Blocks

DeFi is built on:

**Blockchain:** The shared, public ledger recording all transactions.

**Smart contracts:** Self-executing programs that run on blockchain.

**Tokens:** Digital assets that can be traded, lent, borrowed, and used as collateral.

**Wallets:** Your interface to interact with DeFi protocols.

These pieces combine like Lego blocks. DeFi protocols can plug into each other, creating complex financial tools from simple components.

---

## What You Can Do With DeFi

Common DeFi activities:

**Swap tokens:** Trade one cryptocurrency for another without an exchange account.

**Earn yield:** Deposit assets to earn interest (often higher than traditional savings).

**Borrow:** Put up collateral and borrow other assets.

**Provide liquidity:** Supply assets to trading pools and earn fees.

**Stake:** Lock tokens to help secure a network and earn rewards.

Each of these would require applications, approvals, and accounts in traditional finance. In DeFi, they're available to anyone with a wallet.

---

## Why DeFi Is Exciting

**Accessibility:** Anyone with internet and crypto can use it. No credit checks, no minimum balances, no geographic restrictions.

**Transparency:** All transactions are public. Protocol rules are open source. You can verify everything.

**Composability:** Protocols can work together. Innovation happens fast because builders don't need permission.

**Control:** You maintain custody of your assets. No company can freeze your DeFi activity.

---

## Why DeFi Has Risks

**Smart contract bugs:** Code can have vulnerabilities. Exploits have cost billions.

**Complexity:** More moving parts = more ways things can go wrong.

**Volatility:** Assets used in DeFi are often highly volatile.

**Irreversibility:** Mistakes can't be undone. No customer support.

**Regulatory uncertainty:** Laws around DeFi are still developing.

Understanding both the potential and the risks is essential before participating.
