## Building Experience Safely

**Start small:**
Every new protocol, start with amounts you can afford to lose entirely.

**Learn by doing:**
Reading about DeFi only goes so far. Actual transactions build real understanding.

**Review and reflect:**
After transactions, check what happened. Did gas match expectations? Did you receive what you expected?

**Ask questions:**
Communities exist for most protocols. Don't be afraid to ask.

---

## Resources for Continued Learning

**Protocol documentation:**
Most major protocols have extensive docs explaining their mechanics.

**Community channels:**
Discord servers, forums, and Twitter/X are where discussions happen.

**DeFi news sites:**
Stay current with what's happening in the space.

**On-chain data:**
Tools like DeFiLlama, DeBank help you see what's happening across DeFi.

**This curriculum:**
Return to lessons as refreshers. Concepts make more sense with experience.
