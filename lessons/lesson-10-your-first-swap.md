# Your First Swap

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/intro-to-defi-media/images/lesson_10/intro-to-defi_10_header.png)


**Core concept:** A swap is trading one token for another on a DEX—the simplest DeFi transaction and a great way to start.

## Currency Exchange Kiosk

Remember exchanging dollars for euros at the airport? The kiosk shows a rate, you hand over dollars, you get euros.

A DEX swap is the same:
- The DEX shows the exchange rate
- You send Token A
- You receive Token B
- Transaction complete

No account needed. No waiting. Just wallet, connect, swap.

## Before Your First Swap

**Checklist:**

**☐ Have tokens to swap**
You need the token you're trading (e.g., ETH).

**☐ Have native token for gas**
On Ethereum, you need ETH for gas fees even if swapping other tokens.

**☐ Know what you want**
What token do you want to receive? Verify it's the correct contract address for less-common tokens.

**☐ Use the right DEX**
Uniswap for Ethereum, Jupiter for Solana, etc.

**☐ Verified the URL**
Bookmarked or carefully typed. Not from search ads or links.

## Step-by-Step: Making a Swap


![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/intro-to-defi-media/images/lesson_10/intro-to-defi_10_inline_analogy.png)

Using a DEX like Uniswap as example:

**Step 1: Navigate and Connect**
Go to official DEX URL. Connect your wallet.

**Step 2: Select Tokens**
Choose "From" token (what you're selling) and "To" token (what you're buying).

**Step 3: Enter Amount**
Type how much of the "From" token you want to swap.

**Step 4: Review the Quote**
DEX shows:
- How much you'll receive
- Exchange rate
- Price impact
- Estimated fees

**Step 5: Adjust Slippage (if needed)**
Slippage tolerance determines max difference from quoted price. Default (0.5-1%) is usually fine. Increase for volatile tokens.

**Step 6: Click Swap**
Initiates the transaction request.

**Step 7: Review in Wallet**
Your wallet shows transaction details. Verify:
- Correct tokens
- Reasonable amount
- Acceptable gas fees

**Step 8: Confirm in Wallet**
Approve the transaction.

**Step 9: Wait for Confirmation**
Transaction processes on blockchain. Usually seconds to minutes.

**Step 10: Verify Receipt**
Check your wallet balances. New tokens should appear.

## Understanding Swap Costs

You pay several costs:

**Gas fee:**
Paid to the blockchain for transaction processing. On Ethereum, can range from $5-100+ depending on congestion. On L2s or Solana, usually under $1.

**Trading fee:**
Paid to the DEX/liquidity providers. Typically 0.1-0.3% of trade value.

**Price impact:**
Large trades relative to pool size get worse effective prices.

**Slippage:**
Actual price might differ slightly from quote if price moves during transaction.

For small trades, gas fees often matter more than trading fees.

## Your First Swap: Recommendations

**Start small:**
Even $10-20 is enough to learn. Mistakes are cheaper that way.

**Use common pairs:**
ETH/USDC, SOL/USDC. Well-established with good liquidity.

**Use established DEXs:**
Uniswap, Jupiter, SushiSwap. Audited, battle-tested.

**Check gas before confirming:**
If fees seem abnormally high, network might be congested. Wait or use L2.

**Don't swap into unknown tokens:**
Stick to tokens you've researched until you're experienced.

## After Your Swap

Congratulations! You just:
- Used a smart contract
- Traded without an intermediary
- Completed a DeFi transaction

From here, the DeFi world opens up. But master the basics before advancing.
