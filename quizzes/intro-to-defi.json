          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Non-custodial means no third party holds your funds. When you use DeFi, your crypto stays in your wallet until you make a transaction. You maintain control rather than trusting a company to hold it."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "DeFi code is open-source and transactions are on public blockchains. You can verify exactly how a protocol works, see all transactions, and audit the rules yourself. No hidden fees or mysterious processes."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "TVL shows how much money users have deposited into a protocol. Higher TVL often indicates more trust and adoption. It's a common metric for comparing DeFi protocols, though it's not the only thing that matters."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Any wallet that lets you interact with DeFi protocols (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet) is a 'DeFi wallet.' It's self-custody - you hold the keys and connect to applications when you want to use them."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Connecting your wallet lets the app see your address and propose transactions. Your wallet asks you to approve each transaction - you maintain control. Never give apps your seed phrase; that's different and dangerous."
